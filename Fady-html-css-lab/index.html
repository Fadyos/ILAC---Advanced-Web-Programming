        <h2>Welcome To Our Amazing Spa</h2>

        <p>
          Welcome to The Striped Umbrella — a full-service resort and spa just
          steps from the Gulf of Mexico and ten miles east of Crab Key, Florida.
          Come enjoy the best of both worlds, a secluded sandy beach populated
          with beautiful birds, yet a short drive down the road from world-class
          shopping, restaurants, and entertainment. Bring a good book and leave
          your laptop at the office. You won't want to go home
        </p>
